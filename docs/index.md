Welcome to **_STAT 2102: Applied Statistical Computing_** class. This website contains comprehensive lecture notes and supplements materials/codes given in the class.

&nbsp;

**Course Description:** This course is an introduction to `R programming`. After learning basic programming components, such as defining variables and vectors, and learning different data structures in R, students will, via assignments, study more advanced topics, such as conditionals, modular programming, data visualization, and various R packages. Students will also learn the fundamental concepts in computational complexity and will practice writing reports based on their data analyses.

&nbsp;

**Course Objectives:** The purpose of this course is to introduce students to R programming and give them experience with statistical procedures. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

* Manipulate and wrangle data with different structures
* Explore data via visualization and basic models for exploratory data analysis
* Tackle familiar statistical concepts using R
* Communicate results obtained from data analysis
